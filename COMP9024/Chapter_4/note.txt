begin with four illustrative examples of the use of recursion

(1) The factorial function: a classic mathematical function that has a natural recursive definition

(2) An English ruler: has a recursive pattern that is a simple example of a fractal structure

(3) Binary search: one of the most important computer algorithms locating a desired value in a data set with upwards of billions of entries

(4) The file system: a recursive structure in which directories can be nested arbitarily deeply within other directories
